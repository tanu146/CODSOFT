    -Task 1: Spam SMS Detection
            Objective: Develop a machine learning solution to differentiate spam and legitimate SMS, enhancing communication security and user experience.
            Approach: Employed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Logistic Regression for accurate SMS classification. Validated the model's performance through metrics like accuracy and ROC analysis.

    -Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction
            Objective: Create a predictive model to forecast customer churn based on a provided dataset, utilizing machine learning techniques and data analysis.
            Approach: I meticulously preprocessed data with encoding and scaling, built a tuned Random Forest Classifier, and assessed performance with accuracy metrics and visualizations for a holistic customer churn prediction solution.
            
    -Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
            Objective: Build a robust machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, contributing to enhanced financial security by accurately identifying suspicious activities.
            Approach: Thoroughly preprocessed and encoded the dataset, implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms, and rigorously evaluated model performance using key metrics and visualization techniques. The project aims to provide actionable insights and solutions to combat financial fraud effectively.
